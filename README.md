## Project Summary (500 Words)
We solve the Burgers' equation for a 1-dimensional shock tube (Burgers' 1-D) via discovery of optimal parameters (a, m) for a Schrödinger equation such that its Madelung transform is as close as possible to the desired Burgers' equation (with appropriate boundary & initial conditions).

**Tasks:**  
<OL>
<LI>Algorithm Design Brief - ≤ 5page PDF describing the chosen framework (QTN, HSE, or hybrid), mapping of PDE (1D Burgers’ Equation), gate decomposition, and resource estimates.</LI>

<LI>Prototype Code - Open‑source implementation runnable on a noiseless simulator and at least one real QPU backend (IBM, IonQ, Rigetti, Quantinuum, etc.).</LI>

<LI>Validation & Benchmark - Perform a quantitative comparison of the quantum solver against a classical solver reference for the 1-D viscous Burgers shock tube; report L₂-error, wall-clock time, and noisy-simulator metrics (e.g., effective error rates) for ≥ 3 time steps.</LI>

<LI>Resource & Noise Analysis - Table of qubits, two‑qubit‑gate depth, T‑count (if relevant), and mitigation strategy (e.g. ZNE, Clifford data regression).</LI>

<LI>Quantum Hardware Run - Execute at least one time step of the 1‑D Burgers benchmark on a physical QPU and present raw and error‑mitigated results, with runtime and noise diagnostics.</LI>

<LI>Scalability Study - Show how resources scale with grid size.</LI>

<LI>Algorithm Comparison - Discuss trade‑offs between QTN and HSE. </LI>
